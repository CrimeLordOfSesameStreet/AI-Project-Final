waldohunt.EXE is create by Isaac Barrera for CSC 3400 for Dr. Joshua Locklair


The purpose of this game for the AI Project is to demonstrate that the YOLOv11 model for AI object detection is good enough to find a small specific object around
multiple different objects i.e. Waldo in a crowd. While the model was trained with most panels from every "Wheres Waldo" book, the model works
best with all pages from all editions of the first book in the series. Likely because later panels are far busier and Waldo is much more hidden.
With a far larger dataset and time I am confident that the YOLOv11 model can detect Waldo in every book accurately. The goal of this application is
to race the player to find Waldo before the AI "hunts" and finds Waldo first. In testing, the AI finds Waldo accurately most of the time with the
exception that it may misidentify once in a blue moon. Otherwise, it works almost every time. Enjoy playing around with the game, it is the result
of many days of work and is my first ever game so have fun and FIND WALDO before the MACHINE finds it first!
